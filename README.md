# **Transformer Blocks**

## **How to run the files:**

****Part 1 & Part 2:** Encoder & Decoder**

Navigate to the root directory of the `main.py` file.

Run `python main.py`



****Part 3:** Architectural Exploration**

**First,** find the `transformer.py` file:

- **For `TransformerEncoder` class:**
  - Comment out lines 100 to 109.
  - Uncomment lines 111 to 127 (remove the `#` at the beginning of each line).

- **For `TransformerDecoder` class:**
  - Comment out lines 197 to 206.
  - Uncomment lines 208 to 224 (remove the `#` at the beginning of each line).


**Second,** run `python main.py`.


****Notes:****

The directory "PA2_code" contains the starter code.
Feel free to ignore the starter code and implement from scratch.
However, you should use the base settings for the hyperparameters, as specified in main.py.

The directory "PA2_code/speechesdataset" contains the data to be used for this assignment.
